# Notebook: EDA Task 1 - Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of customer purchasing behavior at Rossmann Pharmaceuticals. The analysis aims to understand the impact of various factors, such as promotions and store openings, on customer purchases.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this notebook is to explore how different measures affect purchasing behavior, including:

- Distribution of promotions in training and test sets.
- Sales behavior around holidays.
- Seasonal purchasing trends.
- Correlation between sales and customer counts.
- Impact of promotions on existing and new customers.
- Store performance related to opening and closing times.
- Effects of competitor proximity on sales.

## Data Cleaning
The notebook includes a comprehensive data cleaning process that addresses:
- Detection and handling of outliers.
- Management of missing values to ensure a robust analysis.

## Visualization
Visualizations are employed throughout the notebook to effectively communicate findings, utilizing plots to uncover patterns and trends in the data.

## Logging
To enhance traceability and reproducibility, the notebook employs Python's `logging` library to log key steps and actions taken throughout the analysis. This includes:
- Data loading and cleaning steps.
- Key findings from visualizations.
- Any assumptions made during the analysis.

## Key Questions Explored
The analysis is guided by several key questions, including but not limited to:
- How do promotions influence sales?
- Which stores benefit most from promotional efforts?
- What are the implications of competitor locations on sales?

## Usage
To run this notebook:
1. Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Execute the cells sequentially using `Shift + Enter`.
3. Modify the code as needed to answer additional questions or explore new insights.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, logging (installed via pip if not available)
